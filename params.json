{"name":"Sushi Learns Github Pages","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Sushi's Github page!\r\n\r\n![No one knows you're a dog on the Internet.](http://i.imgur.com/zPQZooR.jpg)\r\n\r\n(Source: Imgur)\r\n\r\nThis is where I'm figuring out what exactly is going on with Github pages. If you're looking for the sushimustwrite online, you're not quite there yet, as this is an instructional site. Below are some of the right places.\r\n\r\n* If you're interested in my technical docs and occasional code, you're almost there! Try [my GIthub](https://github.com/sushimustwrite)\r\n* Want to read some writing with occasional photos? Try [my main site](http://www.sushimustwrite.com)\r\n* Want my photos? Try [my photo site](http://pics.sushimustwrite.com)\r\n* [My tweets](https://twitter.com/sushimustwrite) show you the very exciting day-to-day shenanigans I get into.\r\n* And my side project, [Wikiwrimo](http://www.wikiwrimo.org), is a community wiki for the world's largest writing event.\r\n\r\nBelow is what Github inserted into the body to tell me how to use this. I'm leaving it for now so I can figure things out later. Maybe you'll learn something too.\r\n\r\nHave a great day!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
